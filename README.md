## React Fundamental Concepts Used
- **Components**: Built reusable and modular components like Navbar, Footer, Cards, and more.
- **Props**: Passed data dynamically between parent and child components.
- **State Management**: Managed component states to handle UI changes.
- **Routing**: Used `react-router-dom` for navigation between pages.
- **Hooks**: Utilized hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useLocation`, and `useNavigate` for functionality.

## Data Handling and Management
- **Context API**: Managed global state for the Cart and Wishlist, ensuring data accessibility across components.
- **LocalStorage**: Persisted cart and wishlist data, preventing loss during page reloads.
